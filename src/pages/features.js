          <p>
            Today’s security teams face many challenges—sophisticated hackers, an expanding attack surface,
            an explosion of data and growing infrastructure complexity—that hinder their ability to safeguard data,
            manage user access, and quickly detect and respond to AI security threats. AI is used in cyber security
            to quickly analyze millions of events and identify many different types of threats.

          <h3>Protecting Data Across Hybrid Cloud Environments</h3>
          <p>
            AI tools can identify shadow data, monitor for abnormalities in data access and alert cybersecurity
            professionals about potential threats by malicious actors accessing the data or sensitive information—
            saving valuable time in detecting and remediating issues in real time.
